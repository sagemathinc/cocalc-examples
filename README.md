# Examples for CoCalc

This mainly adds a categorization and meta-description layer on top of this and other example collections.

## Development & Indexing

* edit `index.yaml`
* call `./index.py` or just do a simple `make` to call that script.

## Datamodel

* Goal: autogenerated JSON for the CoCalc UI, such that user can select examples from a library -- no need to think about the specific representation, only the elements that are the actually moving parts for such a selector.

* YAML Document Types

  * first document: metadata
      * description of tags
      * description of license
      * references: point to another index description file
  * remaining documents are for each indexed entry:
      * `src`: Filename/Directory
      * `title`
      * `description`
      * `tags`: for categorization
      * `license`
      * `start`: entry point file

**note**: The `index.py` file contains additional verification of the data for validity and consitency. Just follow what the assert-exceptions complain about ...

## Devnotes

If you forgot to `git clone --recursive`:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

If you want to update all submodules in one go, do something like

    git submodule foreach "git checkout master; git pull origin master"

or with resets

    git submodule foreach "git fetch origin; git checkout master; git reset --hard origin/master"
