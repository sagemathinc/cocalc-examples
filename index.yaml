license: ccby
description: |
  Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath is an incredible good introductory book to Bayesian Statistics.
  It follows a *Jaynesian* and practical approach with very good examples and clear explanations.

  In [this repository](https://github.com/aloctavodia/Statistical-Rethinking-with-Python-and-PyMC3)
  we ported the codes (originally in R and Stan) in the book to PyMC3.
  We are trying to keep the examples as close as possible to those in the book,
  while at the same time trying to express them in the most Pythonic and PyMC3onic way we can.
